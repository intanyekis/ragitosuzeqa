There are plenty of families that will take a couple weeks every year and travel to one of their favorite amusement theme parks around the country, and no we are not talking about Disney World.</p><p>People that go to Disney World for a summer vacation are not interested in the roller coasters and the thrill rides, they are more focused on the magic little mouse and the experience of the entire Disney property. Those people are not ready for what we came here to discuss today, roller coasters.</p><p>Roller coasters have existed since 1884 when the Switchback Railway opened on Coney Island. Ever since then, architects and designers have come up with better, more thrilling and exciting, ways to turn a roller coaster into more than just another short trip that makes your stomach turn upside down.</p><p>From the roller coasters that flip you all around and make you feel as if you were flying to the ones that send you falling at an insane speed in a matter of seconds, these roller coasters have become legendary, and everyone knows about them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, while they look so amazing, these roller coasters have become so popular that the lines to get on one can rival a James Cameron movie. Which is insane because the ride itself is not as long as it appears from the outside looking in.</p><p>Here is our list of the 25 roller coasters with the longest lines, but are super short.</p><h2 id=colossos-heide-park-germany>Colossos (Heide Park, Germany)</h2><p>via wikipedia.com</p><p>One of the most popular roller coasters in the world today is not even open. Colossos has been closed since the middle of 2016 when it was shut down without any explanations from the owners of Heide Park. It was later revealed that the ride needed major renovations that would cost around $12 million and the park simply could not afford to do it.</p><p>So for the ones that were lucky enough to ride this thing prior to its closing, feel free to share your stories about just how long it took you to get on the ride. Technically, since it is still closed, the wait time for this ride is now over two years long.</p><h2 id=wildfire-kolmarden-wildlife-park-sweden>Wildfire (Kolmarden Wildlife Park, Sweden)</h2><p>via veckorevyn.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For almost two minutes, you are taken into three different inversions and 12 hills at an incredible speed of 70 miles per hour. That makes it the fastest wooden coaster in Europe while also being the world's second tallest wooden coaster.</p><p>Back in 2016, this ride almost got taken down when they had their permit revoked. It later returned in 2017 after having been closed for just about a year. That made the thrill riders from all over the world to come in droves when it reopened, causing some of the longest lines the park has ever seen.</p><h2 id=dodonpa-fuji-q-highland-japan>Dodonpa (Fuji-Q Highland, Japan)</h2><p>via gzesh.com</p><p>If you are willing to wait a little while to get onto the Dodonpa roller coaster at Fuji-Q Highland in Japan, then you will be able to ride the world's fastest roller coaster, reaching 110 miles per hour, and also the fastest acceleration on earth, going from zero to 112 miles per hour in 1.56 seconds.</p><p>The speed and acceleration of this ride is so fast that the entire ride lasts under a minute, about 55 seconds of total ride time. So if you wait in line for a couple hours to get onto this ride, do not be shocked when it ends sooner than you thought.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=superman-krypton-coaster-six-flags-fiesta-texas-united-states>Superman: Krypton Coaster (Six Flags Fiesta Texas, United States)</h2><p>via wikipedia.com</p><p>When the Superman: Krypton Coaster first opened in 2000, it was one of the first ever roller coasters without a floor. That means you would be sitting there, with your feet dangling, while being sent through the world's tallest vertical loop, at 145 feet. Since it is floorless, it also owns the world record's for both being the world's tallest and the fastest of all the floorless coasters reaching speeds of 70 miles per hour and topping out at 168 feet high.</p><p>As if this was not enough, Six Flags has decided to make the ride even better by adding a virtual reality element to the ride in the near future.</p><p>If the wait lines were not long enough already, this will make it even tougher to get on this ride.</p><h2 id=katun-mirabilandia-park-italy>Katun (Mirabilandia Park, Italy)</h2><p>via wikipedia.com</p><p>In Italy, there is a ride that is known throughout thrill seekers worldwide as one of the most underrated experiences in roller coaster history. The Katun at Mirabilandia Park is a steel roller coaster that features a vertical loop, zero-g roll, cobra roll, and two corkscrews. It is one thing after another during this crazy thrill ride that reaches around 65 miles per hour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of the multiple roller coaster elements throughout this single coaster, it is&nbsp;starting to become more and more popular in Europe, making it very tough to see much else of the park as the lines have been longer than most of the rides on our list.</p><h2 id=the-smiler-alton-towers-england>The Smiler (Alton Towers, England)</h2><p>via metro.co.uk</p><p>An inversion on a roller coaster is when the riders are turned upside-down and then back to their normal upright position. That alone makes a ride somewhat scary, so imagine a roller coaster that features 14 different inversions, the world record for inversions on a roller coaster.</p><p>The Smiler from Alton Towers in Staffordshire, England has 14 inversions and is such a complicated ride that it was shut down following an accident just a couple years ago. Once it reopened, it took some time before the lines returned, and they have done so by the thousands.</p><h2 id=incredible-hulk-islands-of-adventure-united-states>Incredible Hulk (Islands of Adventure, United States)</h2><p>via pinterest.com</p><p>One of the coolest roller coasters in Orlando, Florida does not belong to Mickey Mouse.

The difference between this ride and all of the other launched coasters is that you are already starting at the top and when you are launched, you are immediately sent into a giant loop that sends you plummeting into the earth at nearly 70 miles per hour.</p><h2 id=lightning-rod-dollywood-united-states>Lightning Rod (Dollywood, United States)</h2><p>via travelandleisure.com</p><p>The Lightning Rod is one of the smoothest looking wooden roller coasters in the world. It sports a classic hot rod train that sends the riders into a massive uphill climb at 45 miles per hour, which is setting you up for the big drop of 165 feet. It hits you very quickly and catches most first time riders completely off guard.</p><p>It was once named the Best New Ride of 2016 at the Golden Ticket Awards and has since followed up with very high rankings in 2016 and 2017. This might be the shortest line of all the rides on this list but do not let that fool you, prepare for a two-hour wait, at least.</p><h2 id=x2-six-flags-magic-mountain-united-states>X2 (Six Flags Magic Mountain, United States)</h2><p>via youtube.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We have seen the normal roller coasters where you sit in a cart and have a bar locked across your legs, holding you in. Then they added new ways to ride by creating roller coasters where you stand up, let your feet dangle in the open air, or ride it backward.</p><p>But the X2 ride opened up with a brand new element, it was the world's first 4th dimension roller coaster. You sit on the side of the track, parallel to it so that you get this feeling of flying as your feet sway in the open sky. Amazing would be an understatement.</p><h2 id=balder-gothenburg-s-liseberg-park-sweden>Balder (Gothenburg's Liseberg Park, Sweden)</h2><p>via rollersdobraz.com</p><p>Numbers do not lie and these are going to make you think twice about taking a trip to Liseberg Park in Gothenburg, Sweden. Of all the amusement parks in the Scandinavian region, this one is by far the best and it is visited by three million people each year. If you do the math, that is about 8,200 people per day. That is enough to keep any park busy year round.</p><p>Since Balder is their biggest and best attraction, it is naturally the hardest to get on because of the long lines of people that have waited for years to get there just to take the two-minute ride.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=takabisha-fuji-q-highland-japan>Takabisha (Fuji-Q Highland, Japan)</h2><p>via roughguides.com</p><p>The drop from the world record holding Takabisha roller coaster in Fuji-Q Highland Park in Japan is an unreal 121-degree drop. That means that you are dropping beyond vertical and are going down nearly upside down. But the drop is not at the start, it is at the end, when you are just about finished riding this thing. It is during that moment that you get sent shooting towards the ground.</p><p>According to Guinness World Records, when they named Takabisha the steepest roller coaster drop in the world, it was the fourteenth Guinness World Record set by the amusement park.</p><h2 id=iron-rattler-six-flags-fiesta-texas-united-states>Iron Rattler (Six Flags Fiesta Texas, United States)</h2><p>via mysanantonio.com</p><p>One of the wildest rollercoaster rides you will ever take in your life is the Iron Rattler in San Antonio, Texas at Six Flags Fiesta Texas. This is the first hybrid coaster that is a mix of wooden and steel roller coaster parts to turn riders upside-down in a zero-g-roll making you feel as if you are floating in the air from your seat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Iron Rattler sounds familiar because it replaced the original coaster in Fiesta Texas called The Rattler, which had been opened since 1992. That was a wild ride by itself but it had to be taken up a notch and the Iron Rattler was born with a bigger drop and faster speeds.</p><h2 id=phoenix-knoebels-resort-united-states>Phoenix (Knoebels Resort, United States)</h2><p>via wikipedia.com</p><p>When the Phoenix roller coaster opened in 1985, it was considered the largest and biggest roller coaster in the world. But at 3,200 feet long, it is not even close to the longest anymore.</p><p>The key feature to this ride, besides having to wait in line in the sweltering heat for many hours just to get in, is the airtime. This rollercoaster gives riders many moments of airtime throughout the ride that is a feature loved by many roller coaster lovers from all over the planet.</p><h2 id=kingda-ka-six-flags-great-adventure-united-states>Kingda Ka (Six Flags Great Adventure, United States)</h2><p>via wikipedia.com</p><p>Many of the roller coasters on our list own world records, or previously owned world records, that were later beaten.

It is featured in three different Six Flags parks but the most important one, the one we are here to discuss today, is the Goliath located at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois.</p><p>For such a short ride, about one minute and 40 seconds long, this ride has enough power and speed to be one of the best on our list simply because it is wooden. The difference between a wooden roller coaster and a steel one when going 72 miles per hour and going down a drop of 180 feet is that you feel less secure and more likely to die, which, in turn, makes the ride even more exciting.</p><h2 id=outlaw-run-silver-dollar-city-united-states>Outlaw Run (Silver Dollar City, United States)</h2><p>via prweb.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The town of Branson, Missouri has been hit a few times in comedy films for being a terrible destination for a family. However, the truth is, Branson is one of the best small cities in America when it comes to amusement parks. The best one you might enjoy while in town is Silver Dollar City and its' featured attraction, the Outlaw Run wooden roller coaster.</p><p>A wooden roller coaster normally does not have any inversion, let alone three, like Outlaw Run has managed to pull off. Those three inversions made Outlaw Run the first wooden roller coaster to ever feature more than one inversion.</p><h2 id=ravine-flyer-ii-waldameer-park-united-states>Ravine Flyer II (Waldameer Park, United States)</h2><p>via wikipedia.com</p><p>From Branson, Missouri to Erie, Pennsylvania, where the next great roller coaster on our list is located. The Ravine Flyer II is located in Waldameer Park and is a hybrid wooden roller coaster that originally opened in 2008.</p><p>Since then, it has gained more media attention and has become one of the most thrilling rides throughout the entire Northeast. It is so impressive that the Golden Ticket Awards has ranked it in their top seven wooden roller coasters every single year since 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=altair-cinecitta-world-italy>Altair (Cinecitta World, Italy)</h2><p>via filmhousetv.com</p><p>The Altair ride in Cinecitta World in Italy is one of a kind for the amusement park as it is a 10 inversion coaster that focuses more on the inversions than the big drops or the top speeds.</p><p>There is a big drop and a large loop right away that sends riders flipping over before sending them into a couple of twists and turns before hitting that infamous 10 inversion part of the track that spins the riders left to right while traveling nearly 60 miles per hour on multiple spins.</p><h2 id=top-thrill-dragster-cedar-point-united-states>Top Thrill Dragster (Cedar Point, United States)</h2><p>via themeparkreview.com</p><p>If you are a fan of drag racing than this will be your favorite ride, ever. It begins where you enter your cart and immediately hit the start line where a red-yellow-green light counts down the start of the coaster.</p><p>Once it hits green, your dragster cart is launched to 120 miles per hour right into a vertical lift that takes you to the top of the track before sending you crashing down to the ground from the 420-foot tall drop. This ride will go quick so make sure not to blink or you will miss the entire thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-inversion-roller-coaster-chimelong-paradise-china>10 Inversion Roller Coaster (Chimelong Paradise, China)</h2><p>via youtube.com</p><p>The details of this ride are simple. It features a vertical loop, cobra roll with two inversions, two corkscrews, and five heartline rolls. In other words, this ride has a little of everything for any roller coaster fan in the world.</p><p>When you get to the inversions, be prepared for some spinning because you will spin around four different times as you fly through the corkscrew. However, it is not called a ten inversion coaster because you only invert four times, no, you flip a total of ten times during the ride.</p><h2 id=piraten-djurs-sommerland-park-denmark>Piraten (Djurs Sommerland Park, Denmark)</h2><p>via parkscout.com</p><p>Unless you are a world traveler than you probably never heard of the Djurs Sommerland Park over in Denmark. It is one of the world's greatest amusement parks that gets very little traction because it is in Denmark of all places.</p><p>As far as roller coasters go in Denmark, this is the highest, at 105 feet, and tallest too. It reaches speeds of 56 miles per hour. This ride puts the rider in a cart that is almost not even there. You have a bar across your body but that is about it. The cart is designed to let the rider think he is floating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kawasemi-tobu-zoo-park-japan>Kawasemi (Tobu Zoo Park, Japan)</h2><p>via themeparkreview.com</p><p>As you step onto the Kawasemi roller coaster at the Tobu Zoo in Japan, you will probably think little of the ride, and that is where you are wrong. For its length, this is a wild ride that gives you multiple big drops, each one scarier than the rest.</p><p>Most coasters use the momentum from the initial drop to make the roller coaster fast enough to make the entire track. This one uses physics to do this but also send you dropping at least four different times.</p><h2 id=full-throttle-six-flags-magic-mountain-united-states>Full Throttle (Six Flags Magic Mountain, United States)</h2><p>via wikipedia.com</p><p>One of the greatest things that make roller coasters so great is how competitive they are when it comes to record-breaking. For example, in Six Flags Magic Mountain, Full Throttle is a steel launched coaster that was once the world's tallest vertical loop, 160 feet. But it was later broken by Flash at Lewa Adventure in China.</p><p>Although it no longer owns the record for the tallest vertical loop, it remains the only one was a top hat attached directly on top of that loop, a record that remains there's still today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=green-lantern-warner-bros-movie-world-australia>Green Lantern (Warner Bros Movie World, Australia)</h2><p>via youtube.com</p><p>The shortest coaster on our list is the Crazy Bird in Happy Valley Tianjin, in China.
